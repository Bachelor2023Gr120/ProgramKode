      <h1>Healthcare Sector</h1>
        <div class="items">         
           <p>There are many requirements that need to be filled for the health-care sector to function properly.
             One of these requirements is that all relevant patient information is shared securely.
              It is crucial that the information is correct and updated, so the patients get the right medications and treatment.
               It is also important that the information is only accessible to the employees that need the information, and that the integrity
                of the system can be trusted by both the patients and the employees. 
           </p>
           <p>This is why keywords like “integrity, availability and confidentiality” summarize the most important points of 
            information security within the health-care sector. Integrity because the information that is processed needs to be correct and 
            have mechanisms to prevent it from getting accidentally modified or deleted. It also must not be able to be modified by 
            unauthorized persons. Availability because the information (personal data) must be available wherever it is needed, at any time. 
            Confidentiality because the information needs to be protected by the proper security mechanisms. 
            It must be protected from access by unauthorized persons and stored in a secure manner.
         </p>
         <p>Privacy is a big focus among health-care providers in Norway. 
          They must comply with the standard GDPR (General Data Protection) rules, but there are also many other national laws related 
          to this sector. This test is designed to test the compliance to these laws. 
          Please note that the questions included are just related to the information security sections of the applicable laws.
           The questions designed specifically for management/leaders, risk managers or data processors are not
           included in this test. This is to save time for the test users of this platform.  
       </p>
       <p>The questions are from “the norm”, which is developed by several organizations within the health sector. 
        It is an established policy with the goal of improving information security and privacy for every organization within healthcare. 
        The test can be modified by the provider if the user wants to include questions 
        that are also designed for employees that are in charge of risk management, processing of health data or management. 
     </p>
     <p>
      Check “yes” or “no” on whether the requirement has been met.
